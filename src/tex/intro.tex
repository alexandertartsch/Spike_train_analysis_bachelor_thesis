\chapter{Introduction}
In this chapter I will give an introduction to the topic. I will give background information about neuropathic pain and the big picture goal of research in this field. \\
-quickly explain how the transmission of pain functions inside our bodies\\
-what is my bachelor thesis based on (paper from Roberto)\\
-contextualize thesis topic within the big picture \\
-talk quickly about openMNGlab and goal of adding analysis functionality and discuss software engineering goals for the framework\\

There are many unsolved problems in the medical sciences. One of which is neuropathic pain, which is a type of chronic pain that can appear at any moment without any obvious factors coming from the outside. It can stem from diseases taht effect the nerves, but also from infection or injury.\\
-TODO find number of people in Germany that suffer from neuropathic pain\\
-TODO: Find out more details on neuropathic pain \\
Pain is transmitted as electric signals through the nerves inside our bodies. Because of this fact in order to understand different types of pain such as neuropathic pain for one we need to understand the transmission of electrical signals in nerve fibers.
 \\
 We analyse data containing bursts of action potential activity as a potential proxy for neuropathic pain as the end goal. We do this in order to potentially detect this type of pain activity in neuropathic pain patients in the future.\\
Quantifying pain can be done by measuring electrical activity of corresponding nerve fibers. By doing this we get data about the amount of electrical activity. We can also gather specifics about the way the electrical signals are being sent through the body. There are multiple ways in which one can measure electrical activity in human bodies. One of these methods is called microneurography, which is the technique most relevant for the rest of this thesis.


One of which is called microneurography. This is a technique that is used to record nerve activity in peripheral nerves. With this technique typically a needle gets inserted into a nerve fiber which then detects the electrical current in the fiber. Additionally, we can stimulate the nerve fiber to get certain responses. \\
Nerve fibers transmit data with the use of action potentials, short AP or spike. It has been shown in previous research that information is not transmitted by the shape or amplitude of the spikes, but the frequency and timings (look the exact papers up again).
