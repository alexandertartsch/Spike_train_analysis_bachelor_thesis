Currently, openMNGlab loads data from Spike2 and Dapsys, which are two major data acquisition solutions. By building on top of the Neo software, openMNGlab can be easily extended to handle the most common electrophysiological data formats. Furthermore, it provides methods for data visualization, fiber tracking, and a modular feature database to extract features for data analysis and machine learning.},

	abstract = {Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard ‘open-loop’ visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.},

	abstract = {Activity-dependent processes in slowly conducting afferents have been shown to modulate conduction and receptive properties, but it is not known how the frequency of action potential firing determines the responses of such fibers to mechanical stimulation. We examined the responses of slowly conducting meningeal afferents to mechanical stimuli and the influence of preceding action potential activity. In hemisected rat heads with adhering cranial dura mater, recordings were made from meningeal nerves. Dural receptive fields of mechanically sensitive afferent fibers were stimulated with a custom-made electromechanostimulator. Sinusoidal mechanical stimuli of different stimulus durations and amplitudes were applied to produce either high-frequency (phasic) or low-frequency (tonic) discharges. Most fibers showed slowing of their axonal conduction velocity on electrically evoked activity at ≥2 Hz. In this state, the peak firing frequency of phasic responses to a 250-ms mechanical stimulus was significantly reduced compared with control. In contrast, the frequency of tonic responses induced by mechanical stimuli of {\textgreater}500 ms did not change. In a rare subtype of afferents, which showed conduction velocity speeding during activity, an increase in the phasic responses to mechanical stimuli was observed. Depending on the axonal properties of the afferent fibers, encoding of phasic components of mechanical stimuli is altered according to the immediate firing history. Preceding activity in mechanoreceptors slowing their conduction velocity seems to provide a form of low-pass filtering of action potential discharges predominantly reducing the phasic component. This may improve discrimination between harmless and potentially harmful mechanical stimuli in normal tissue.},

It includes algorithms for simple and advanced analysis, such as time-frequency analysis using multitapers, source reconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers, connectivity analysis, and nonparametric statistical permutation tests at the channel and source level. The implementation as toolbox allows the user to perform elaborate and structured analyses of large data sets using the MATLAB command line and batch scripting. Furthermore, users and developers can easily extend the functionality and implement new algorithms. The modular design facilitates the reuse in other software packages.},

	abstract = {The detection of neural spike activity is a technical challenge that is a prerequisite for studying many types of brain function. Measuring the activity of individual neurons accurately can be difﬁcult due to large amounts of background noise and the difﬁculty in distinguishing the action potentials of one neuron from those of others in the local area. This article reviews algorithms and methods for detecting and classifying action potentials, a problem commonly referred to as spike sorting. The article ﬁrst discusses the challenges of measuring neural activity and the basic issues of signal detection and classiﬁcation. It reviews and illustrates algorithms and techniques that have been applied to many of the problems in spike sorting and discusses the advantages and limitations of each and the applicability of these methods for different types of experimental demands. The article is written both for the physiologist wanting to use simple methods that will improve experimental yield and minimize the selection biases of traditional techniques and for those who want to apply or extend more sophisticated algorithms to meet new experimental challenges.},

	abstract = {We conducted a large nationwide postal survey to estimate the prevalence of chronic pain with or without neuropathic characteristics in the French general population. A questionnaire aimed at identifying chronic pain (defined as daily pain for at least 3 months), evaluating its intensity, duration and body locations, was sent to a representative sample of 30,155 subjects. The DN4 questionnaire was used to identify neuropathic characteristics. Of the questionnaires, 24,497 (81.2\%) were returned and 23,712 (96.8\%) could be assessed. Seven thousand five hundred and twenty-two respondents reported chronic pain (prevalence=31.7\%; [95\%CI: 31.1–32.3]) and 4709 said the pain intensity was moderate to severe (prevalence=19.9\%; [95\%CI: 19.5–20.4]). Neuropathic characteristics were reported by 1631 respondents with chronic pain (prevalence=6.9\%; [95\%CI: 6.6–7.2]), which was moderate to severe in 1209 (prevalence=5.1\% [95\%CI: 4.8–5.4]). A higher prevalence of chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics was associated with middle age (50–64 years), manual professions and those living in rural areas. It was more frequently located in the lower limbs and its intensity and duration were higher in comparison with chronic pain without neuropathic characteristics. This large national population-based study indicates that a significant proportion of chronic pain patients report neuropathic characteristics. We identified distinctive socio-demographic profile and clinical features indicating that chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics is a specific health problem.},

	abstract = {Most patients with neuropathic pain symptoms present and are managed in primary care, with only a minority being referred for specialist clinical assessment and diagnoses. Previous reviews have focused mainly on specific neuropathic pain conditions based in specialist settings. This is the first systematic review of epidemiological studies of neuropathic pain in the general population. Electronic databases were searched from January 1966 to December 2012, and studies were included where the main focus was on neuropathic pain prevalence and/or incidence, either as part of a specific neuropathic pain-related condition or as a global entity in the general population. We excluded studies in which data were extracted from pain or other specialist clinics or focusing on specific population subgroups. Twenty-one articles were identified and underwent quality assessment and data extraction. Included studies differed in 3 main ways: method of data retrieval, case ascertainment tool used, and presentation of prevalence/incidence rates. This heterogeneity precluded any meta-analysis. We categorised comparable incidence and prevalence rates into 2 main subgroups: (1) chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics (range 3–17\%), and (2) neuropathic pain associated with a specific condition, including postherpetic neuralgia (3.9–42.0/100,000 person–years [PY]), trigeminal neuralgia (12.6–28.9/100,000 PY), painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (15.3–72.3/100,000 PY), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (0.2–0.4/100,000 PY). These differences highlight the importance of a standardised approach for identifying neuropathic pain in future epidemiological studies. A best estimate of population prevalence of pain with neuropathic characteristics is likely to lie between 6.9\% and 10\%.},
