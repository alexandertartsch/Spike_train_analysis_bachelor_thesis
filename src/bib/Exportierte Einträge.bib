	abstract = {Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard ‘open-loop’ visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.},

	abstract = {Activity-dependent processes in slowly conducting afferents have been shown to modulate conduction and receptive properties, but it is not known how the frequency of action potential firing determines the responses of such fibers to mechanical stimulation. We examined the responses of slowly conducting meningeal afferents to mechanical stimuli and the influence of preceding action potential activity. In hemisected rat heads with adhering cranial dura mater, recordings were made from meningeal nerves. Dural receptive fields of mechanically sensitive afferent fibers were stimulated with a custom-made electromechanostimulator. Sinusoidal mechanical stimuli of different stimulus durations and amplitudes were applied to produce either high-frequency (phasic) or low-frequency (tonic) discharges. Most fibers showed slowing of their axonal conduction velocity on electrically evoked activity at ≥2 Hz. In this state, the peak firing frequency of phasic responses to a 250-ms mechanical stimulus was significantly reduced compared with control. In contrast, the frequency of tonic responses induced by mechanical stimuli of {\textgreater}500 ms did not change. In a rare subtype of afferents, which showed conduction velocity speeding during activity, an increase in the phasic responses to mechanical stimuli was observed. Depending on the axonal properties of the afferent fibers, encoding of phasic components of mechanical stimuli is altered according to the immediate firing history. Preceding activity in mechanoreceptors slowing their conduction velocity seems to provide a form of low-pass filtering of action potential discharges predominantly reducing the phasic component. This may improve discrimination between harmless and potentially harmful mechanical stimuli in normal tissue.},

Measuring the activity of individual neurons accurately can be difﬁcult due to large amounts of background noise and the difﬁculty in distinguishing the action potentials of one neuron from those of others in the local area. This article reviews algorithms and methods for detecting and classifying action potentials, a problem commonly referred to as spike sorting. The article ﬁrst discusses the challenges of measuring neural activity and the basic issues of signal detection and classiﬁcation. It reviews and illustrates algorithms and techniques that have been applied to many of the problems in spike sorting and discusses the advantages and limitations of each and the applicability of these methods for different types of experimental demands. The article is written both for the physiologist wanting to use simple methods that will improve experimental yield and minimize the selection biases of traditional techniques and for those who want to apply or extend more sophisticated algorithms to meet new experimental challenges.},

	abstract = {1. The effects of impulse activity on conduction in cutaneous C fibres have been examined in 46 microneurographic recordings from 11 normal subjects and 11 diabetic patients with normal nerve conduction. A tungsten microelectrode was inserted into a cutaneous nerve, usually the superficial peroneal close to the ankle, and intraneural microstimulation was used to identify an area of skin innervated. Three minute trains of 0.25 ms stimuli at 1, 2 and 4 Hz were then delivered to the surface of the skin, separated by intervals of 6 min with stimulation at 0.25 Hz. Slowing and block of conduction were measured from the nerve responses for up to seven C units per stimulation sequence. 2. Three types of C unit were distinguished by their responses to repetitive stimulation: type 1 units slowed progressively during the 3 min trains; slowing of type 2 units reached a plateau within 1 min; while type 3 units hardly slowed at all. Data from normal and diabetic subjects did not differ and were pooled. After 3 min at 2 Hz, the percentage increases in latency were for type 1, 28.3 +/- 9.7 (n = 63 units, mean +/- s.d.); for type 2, 5.2 +/- 1.6 (n = 14); and for type 3, 0.8 +/- 0.5 (n = 5), with no overlap. After 3 min at 4 Hz, 58 \% of type 1 units (but no type 2 or 3 units) blocked intermittently. Recovery of latency after stimulation was faster for type 2 than for type 1 units, but conduction velocities of the three types were similar. 3. Type 1 units were identified as nociceptors and 7 type 2 units were identified as 'cold' fibres, activated by non-noxious cold, with no overlap in modality. None of the units tested was activated by weak mechanical stimuli or reflex sympathetic activation. 4. Spike waveforms were averaged for 18 type 1, 10 type 2 and 6 type 3 units. All units had predominantly triphasic action potentials with a major negative peak, but those of type 3 units were on average both smaller and briefer than those of type 1 and type 2 units. 5. It is concluded that repetitive electrical stimulation reliably differentiates nociceptive from cold-specific C fibres innervating human hairy skin, as has previously been shown for the rat. Cold fibres can propagate impulses continuously at much higher rates than nociceptive fibres. The nature of the type 3 units is unclear.},

One of the problems is the unclear dependence of the Fano factor on the spiking rate, which is often neglected or handled insufficiently.

Utilizing a multi-modal approach, we investigated how NaV1.7 mutations lead to human pain insensitivity. Skin biopsy and microneurography revealed an absence of C-fiber nociceptors in CIP patients, reflected in a reduced cortical response to capsaicin on fMRI. Epitope tagging of endogenous NaV1.7 revealed the channel to be localized at the soma membrane, axon, axon terminals, and the nodes of Ranvier of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) nociceptors. CIP patient-derived iPSC nociceptors exhibited an inability to properly respond to depolarizing stimuli, demonstrating that NaV1.7 is a key regulator of excitability. Using this iPSC nociceptor platform, we found that some NaV1.7 blockers undergoing clinical trials lack specificity. CIP, therefore, arises due to a profound loss of functional nociceptors, which is more pronounced than that reported in rodent models, or likely achievable following acute pharmacological blockade.

	abstract = {An essential aspect of scientific reproducibility is a coherent and complete acquisition of metadata along with the actual data of an experiment. The high degree of complexity and heterogeneity of neuroscience experiments requires a rigorous management of the associated metadata. The odML framework represents a solution to organize and store complex metadata digitally in a hierarchical format that is both human and machine readable. However, this hierarchical representation of metadata is difficult to handle when metadata entries need to be collected and edited manually during the daily routines of a laboratory. With odMLtables, we present an open-source software solution that enables users to collect, manipulate, visualize, and store metadata in tabular representations (in [xls]\{\} or [csv]\{\} format) by providing functionality to convert these tabular collections to the hierarchically structured metadata format odML, and to either extract or merge subsets of a complex metadata collection. With this, odMLtables bridges the gap between handling metadata in an intuitive way that integrates well with daily lab routines and commonly used software products on the one hand, and the implementation of a complete, well-defined metadata collection for the experiment in a standardized format on the other hand. We demonstrate usage scenarios of the odMLtables tools in common lab routines in the context of metadata acquisition and management, and show how the tool can assist in exploring published datasets that provide metadata in the odML format.},

	abstract = {The maximal information that the spike train of any neuron can pass on to subsequent neurons can be quantified as the neuronal firing pattern entropy. Difficulties associated with estimating entropy from small datasets have proven an obstacle to the widespread reporting of firing pattern entropies and more generally, the use of information theory within the neuroscience community. In the most accessible class of entropy estimation techniques, spike trains are partitioned linearly in time and entropy is estimated from the probability distribution of firing patterns within a partition. Ample previous work has focused on various techniques to minimize the finite dataset bias and standard deviation of entropy estimates from under-sampled probability distributions on spike timing events partitioned linearly in time. In this manuscript we present evidence that all distribution-based techniques would benefit from inter-spike intervals being partitioned in logarithmic time. We show that with logarithmic partitioning, firing rate changes become independent of firing pattern entropy. We delineate the entire entropy estimation process with two example neuronal models, demonstrating the robust improvements in bias and standard deviation that the logarithmic time method yields over two widely used linearly partitioned time approaches.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientists use many different software tools to acquire, analyse and visualise electrophysiological signals. However, incompatible data models and file formats make it difficult to exchange data between these tools. This reduces scientific productivity, renders potentially useful analysis methods inaccessible and impedes collaboration between labs.A common representation of the core data would improve interoperability and facilitate data-sharing.To that end, we propose here a language-independent object model, named "Neo", suitable for representing data acquired from electroencephalographic, intracellular, or extracellular recordings, or generated from simulations. As a concrete instantiation of this object model we have developed an open source implementation in the Python programming language.In addition to representing electrophysiology data in memory for the purposes of analysis and visualisation, the Python implementation provides a set of input/output (IO) modules for reading/writing the data from/to a variety of commonly used file formats.Support is included for formats produced by most of the major manufacturers of electrophysiology recording equipment and also for more generic formats such as MATLAB.Data representation and data analysis are conceptually separate: it is easier to write robust analysis code if it is focused on analysis and relies on an underlying package to handle data representation.For that reason, and also to be as lightweight as possible, the Neo object model and the associated Python package are deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualisation.Software for neurophysiology data analysis and visualisation built on top of Neo automatically gains the benefits of interoperability, easier data sharing and automatic format conversion; there is already a burgeoning ecosystem of such tools. We intend that Neo should become the standard basis for Python tools in neurophysiology.},

	abstract = {The generation of pain signals from primary afferent neurons is explained by a labeled-line code. However, this notion cannot apply in a simple way to cutaneous C-fibers, which carry signals from a variety of receptors that respond to various stimuli including agonist chemicals. To represent the discharge patterns of C-fibers according to different agonist chemicals, we have developed a quantitative approach using three consecutive spikes. By using this method, the generation of pain in response to chemical stimuli is shown to be dependent on the temporal aspect of the spike trains. Furthermore, under pathological conditions, gamma-aminobutyric acid resulted in pain behavior without change of spike number but with an altered discharge pattern. Our results suggest that information about the agonist chemicals may be encoded in specific temporal patterns of signals in C-fibers, and nociceptive sensation may be influenced by the extent of temporal summation originating from the temporal patterns.},

	abstract = {Background
The marking technique in microneurography uses stimulus-induced changes in neural conduction velocity to characterize human C-fibers. Changes in conduction velocity are manifested as variations in the temporal latency between periodic electrical stimuli and the resulting APs. When successive recorded sweeps are displayed vertically in a “waterfall” format, APs correlated with the stimulus form visible vertical tracks. Automated detection of these latency tracks is made difficult by sometimes poor signal-to-noise ratio in recordings, spontaneous neural firings uncorrelated with the stimuli, and multi-unit recordings with crossing or closely parallel tracks.
New method
We developed an automated track-detection technique based on a local linearization of the latency tracks of stimulus-correlated APs. This technique enhances latency tracks, eliminates transient noise spikes and spontaneous neural activity not correlated with the stimulus, and automatically detects latency tracks across successive sweeps in a recording.
Results
We evaluated our method on microneurography recordings showing varying signal quality, spontaneous firing, and multiple tracks that run closely parallel and cross. The method showed excellent detection of latency tracks in all of our recordings.
Comparison with existing method(s)
We compare our method to the commonly used track detection method of Hammarberg as implemented in the Drever program.
Conclusions
Our method is a robust means of automatically detecting latency tracks in typical microneurography recordings.},

	abstract = {Most patients with neuropathic pain symptoms present and are managed in primary care, with only a minority being referred for specialist clinical assessment and diagnoses. Previous reviews have focused mainly on specific neuropathic pain conditions based in specialist settings. This is the first systematic review of epidemiological studies of neuropathic pain in the general population. Electronic databases were searched from January 1966 to December 2012, and studies were included where the main focus was on neuropathic pain prevalence and/or incidence, either as part of a specific neuropathic pain-related condition or as a global entity in the general population. We excluded studies in which data were extracted from pain or other specialist clinics or focusing on specific population subgroups. Twenty-one articles were identified and underwent quality assessment and data extraction. Included studies differed in 3 main ways: method of data retrieval, case ascertainment tool used, and presentation of prevalence/incidence rates. This heterogeneity precluded any meta-analysis. We categorised comparable incidence and prevalence rates into 2 main subgroups: (1) chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics (range 3–17\%), and (2) neuropathic pain associated with a specific condition, including postherpetic neuralgia (3.9–42.0/100,000 person–years [PY]), trigeminal neuralgia (12.6–28.9/100,000 PY), painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (15.3–72.3/100,000 PY), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (0.2–0.4/100,000 PY). These differences highlight the importance of a standardised approach for identifying neuropathic pain in future epidemiological studies. A best estimate of population prevalence of pain with neuropathic characteristics is likely to lie between 6.9\% and 10\%.},

	abstract = {C-nociceptors do not normally fire action potentials unless challenged by adequate noxious stimuli. However, in pathological states nociceptors may become hyperexcitable and may generate spontaneous ectopic discharges. The aim of this study was to compare rat neuropathic pain models and to assess their suitability to model the spontaneous C-nociceptor activity found in neuropathic pain patients. Studies were performed in normal rats (n=40), healthy human subjects (n=15), peripheral neuropathic pain patients (n=20), and in five rat neuropathic pain models: nerve crush (n=24), suture (n=14), chronic constriction injury (n=12), STZ-induced diabetic neuropathy (n=56), and ddC-induced neuropathy (n=15). Microneurographic recordings were combined with electrical stimulation to monitor activity in multiple C fibers. Stimulation at 0.25Hz allowed spontaneous impulses to be identified by fluctuations in baseline latency. Abnormal latency fluctuations could be produced by several mechanisms, and spontaneous activity was most reliably identified by the presence of unexplained latency increases corresponding to two or more additional action potentials. Spontaneous activity was present in a proportion of mechano-insensitive C-nociceptors in the patients and all rat models. The three focal traumatic nerve injury models provided the highest proportion (59.5\%), whereas the two polyneuropathy models had fewer (18.6\%), and the patients had an intermediate proportion (33.3\%). Spontaneously active mechano-sensitive C-nociceptors were not recorded. Microneurographic recordings of spontaneous activity in diseased C-nociceptors may be useful for both short- and long-term drug studies, both in animals and in humans.},

A questionnaire aimed at identifying chronic pain (defined as daily pain for at least 3 months), evaluating its intensity, duration and body locations, was sent to a representative sample of 30,155 subjects. The DN4 questionnaire was used to identify neuropathic characteristics. Of the questionnaires, 24,497 (81.2\%) were returned and 23,712 (96.8\%) could be assessed. Seven thousand five hundred and twenty-two respondents reported chronic pain (prevalence=31.7\%; [95\%CI: 31.1–32.3]) and 4709 said the pain intensity was moderate to severe (prevalence=19.9\%; [95\%CI: 19.5–20.4]). Neuropathic characteristics were reported by 1631 respondents with chronic pain (prevalence=6.9\%; [95\%CI: 6.6–7.2]), which was moderate to severe in 1209 (prevalence=5.1\% [95\%CI: 4.8–5.4]). A higher prevalence of chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics was associated with middle age (50–64 years), manual professions and those living in rural areas. It was more frequently located in the lower limbs and its intensity and duration were higher in comparison with chronic pain without neuropathic characteristics. This large national population-based study indicates that a significant proportion of chronic pain patients report neuropathic characteristics. We identified distinctive socio-demographic profile and clinical features indicating that chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics is a specific health problem.},
